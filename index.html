        <p class="lead mb-4">Within school, students or people with language barriers must learn language acquisition which requires a growth mindset. During my first year in Fall Quarter 2020, I remember when Gabriel and Ashley were my TAs for CHASS First-Year Community Workshop, where we met each other at the Zoom class once every Friday from 10:00 to 10:50 am. During week six of the fall quarter, Gabriel and Ashley gave my classmates advice while presenting about skills that can help us a lot throughout our four years of college; they talked explicitly about attending office hours and the importance. When Gabriel spoke about office hours while Ashley helped Gabriel doing the slide transition, Gabriel said, ‚ÄúGoing to the office hours will help change your life a lot. Asking a professor for help will lead you to have a better growth mindset.‚Äù(Gabriel). Nevertheless, I find it necessary to attend the professor‚Äôs office hours because of my growth mindset. Furthermore, It shows you are willing to persevere to achieve your goals by doing something despite its difficulty. In the end, going to one of our professor‚Äôs office hours is an example of a student or person who had an open mind with a perseverance growth mindset for learning the language. Still, it is a slow process but allows one to reach goals in the future.
For instance, we can also use the dragon boat. I currently do this sport because my growth mindset allows me to learn new things from other people by having a vulnerable character. On February 8, 2020, in San Francisco, I remember that I was doing a crew roster trial alone with my team, fighting for the top number one best crew roster. Generally, the registration for making it to the best crew is very competitive and hectic because it‚Äôs only limited to 20 paddlers with two substitutes. In the end, I didn‚Äôt make it to the top crew in my team. I also didn‚Äôt make it to the second crew, which I used to paddle back in Long Beach in July and Lake Merritt in September 2019.  Despite this, I felt humiliated and unmotivated. After all, I thought I was a lousy athlete because I was put on the third crew, the lowest rank as the last race of my senior year of high school dragon boat team. However, I remember the time when I felt like giving up; my former team captain and teammate Daven, who is currently our assistant coach, offered advice that helped me preserve through this time of feeling unworthy. Daven told me this at Lake Merced after the practice ended at 3 pm, ‚ÄúI know you didn‚Äôt achieve what you want, but I know Benny is a person who works hard and never gave up anything because you are not perfect at anything.‚Äù(Daven). Nevertheless, this is another reason I agree with using dragon boats as an example of how who have a growth mindset. Furthermore, it shows dragonboat can help you

        Firstly, the importance of naming in personal identity is valid because people should preserve their own identity by passing down their ethnic culture to the next generation of their child. For example, when I was back in China before I moved down to America on May 8, 2008, my parents always taught me about our Chinese culture by teaching me Chinese values and language. Yet, when I moved to the U.S. when I was seven years old living in San Francisco, I started to shift my Chinese culture despite living in America for 13 years, where I had American culture on my side. However, when I was in high school during my junior year, My dad always told me, "You had lived in America for 11 years, but one thing you can never forget is our family line and our Chinese culture. Therefore, you must pass down to your future child regardless if you had an American culture on your side" (Benny's Dad).  Significantly, passing down the family line and our culture to our future child is essential because people need to preserve their own culture and family line by educating our child that their ethnic value is passing down their family line.   
	For instance, naming our child's ethnic names can relate to Crastra's argument of the importance of naming in determining personal identity. The ethnic name had a philosophical meaning that defines our name as our identity. For example, in 2001, before I was born in China, my parents wanted to acquire my Chinese name to preserve our family tradition and values in the future. Moreover, my grandma, who currently lives in China, had the closest friend, a philosopher giving my name as 'Âê¥Â≠êË¥§' or 'Zixian Wu.' Moreover, my Chinese name means "a child who is virtuous toward their family and friends," which I value my Chinese name throughout my life because it is essential to me.  However, when I moved to America, I started to use my English name as 'Benny' instead of Zixian because my mom wanted my friends and teacher to pronounce my name correctly. Likewise, my mom told me, "I am changing your name as Benny but with a middle name as 'Zixian' and last name as 'Wu' because I don't want you to forget your ethnic character and identity" (Benny's Mom). Significantly, naming our child an ethnic name can be related to Cratra's argument because people need to teach our children to preserve their family and cultural values for their next generation.
	Generally speaking, people need to pass down their family line to the next generation child. Despite teaching the future kids of their own culture and ethnic name, what defines us is their own family and ethnicity. Furthermore, I think people should give our children an ethnic name and preserve our culture and values regardless of people living in America with an English name and American culture. For example, in Chinese culture, my parents taught me Chinese values and language because they

        According to Eleanor Turner, parents should keep in mind when naming their children is their cultural names. Furthermore, she also explains that Social Security Administration is responsible for tracking baby names in this country every year. They publish a data set; people can go online find it on ssa.gov. Every year this data set contains every single baby name registered in this country with five or more registrations that Social Security Administration cannot work due to privacy issues. Nevertheless, I think that her ideas are vital to my personal experience and observations. When Turner mentions that celebrities pick the flip side of this, many people tend to choose names similar to their friends in their family and other people in their community. 
Firstly, my experience is about my parents giving my name to me when I was born in China. My mom told me how I acquired my Chinese name back in 2001 is when my grandma in China. She had her closest friend, a philosopher giving my name ‚ÄúWu Zi Xian‚Äù as my Chinese name. It means a child who is virtuous around his peers and family. I found out what my Chinese name stands for and how I got my name from my grandma, her closest friend, a philosopher. After my mom told her story, I realized my cultural name is crucial because it is my identities. 
In 2008, when I was seven years old kid, I move out from China to the U.S. with my parent, living in San Francisco for 14 years right now. My parents did the first thing: they register their English name by using their cultural name, including me. Then in 2009, my mom apply me to the tutoring program at presbyterian church, they help me sign my Chinese name or my cultural name, but then the system didn‚Äôt work on my Chinese name. Instead of using my Chinese name, they recommend an English name I can use for my computer system. The manager‚Äôs name was Annie, she gave me the exact name Benny, and I took it, and i was didn‚Äôt. Furthermore, in 2010, my mom was thinking about changing my Chinese to my English as Benny instead of Zixian because she thinks my peer and my school think it is awkward to use my Chinese name. I remember my mom wanted me to preserve my cultural name instead of internalizing it because my parent wanted me to persevere my Chinese culture and values. Within, she went to federal office and officially changed my name a ‚ÄúBenny Zixian Wu.‚ÄùWe must get people‚Äôs names right because it is pronouncing someone's
name is so important beyond the fact that it's the right thing to do to ensure people feel valued, honored, and respected; mispronouncing someone's name leads to invisibility, and they can also have financial implications. Despite this, mispronouncing someone's word leads to invisibility, and we know that when a
